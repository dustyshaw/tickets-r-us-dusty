# Tickets R Us
A simple web and mobile project to obtain tickets to events. Tickets generate a QR code which is sent to the users email. From there, you can use the mobile app to scan a ticket. 
This project features a CI/CD pipeline leveraging Azure and Github Actions to facilitate continuous development.
